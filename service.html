<p style="color:pink;"> The universal financing of institutions like education creates more economic opportunities and reduces class inequality, therefore reducing crime. The Nordic countries use the taxes they receive to fund public needs like education, which is beneficial to the society. “Collective financing for schools benefits society by creating more human capital which is important for production and incomes”. The model of collective financing can be seen to have a more positive than negative effect on crime, as the opportunities in the economy are more available. The public supply of “services contributes to a reduction in inequality; that is, there is a progressive element in welfare provision.” (Anderson, 2021, p. 29) The widely available services are shown to reduce the inequality between the poor and the wealthy, and “education enhances labor force participation and productivity”. The economy and the education system are helping each other simultaneously, as the schools enhance the labor market, and the economy is making school available to all. “Access to free education or healthcare clearly matters more to low-income families than to high-income families” (Anderson, 2021, p. 29) This shows how free education can help economically unequal families, which again reduces inequality among the society. Rosenfeld and Messner describe education as the “socialization or the ‘transmission of basic cultural standards  to the new generation” (Sugrue, 1996, p. 133). The American school system puts a strong emphasis on the economic role of the  student after school, and less of the societal role they will have in life. This cultural system in the United States is a large factor in the crime rates, and the continuous teachings of these values is why the crime rates are higher than the Nordic countries. Also, the private financing of education and other services implies who can have access to them, which creates more divide and inequality, which increases the crime rates.

<p style="color:pink;"> The Welfare States progressive tax system makes the polity accommodated by the economy, therefore producing lesser crime rates. Since the  “welfare state'' is paid for through a system of “progressive taxation”, the average tax price goes up as your income rises, which means everyone is paying their equal part. “Progressive taxation controls the economy from dominating other institutions” (Anderson, 2021, p. 28): The policies that the government has put in place about taxes has helped keep the economy from dominating the society, proving the polity isn’t devalued compared to the economy as it would be in the United States. “In other words, to reap the beneficial effects of the automatic stabilizers, fiscal discipline is needed” (Anderson, 2021, p. 31). In order for the society's economy to gain money from the welfare systems, the government must spend responsibly to sustain economic growth, showing the polity is accommodated by the economy, Rosenfeld and Mesner describe polity as “the political structure that “mobilizes and distributes power to attain collective goals”.  In the US, the economy is accommodated by the government, which means that their collective goals are ultimately aimed at improving the economy, and not the lives of the people. “Crime in America derives in significant measure from high prized cultural and social conditions.” (Sugrue, 1996, p. 131) The quote from Rosenfeld and Mesner’s work argues that the economically dominating culture of the United States is a main issue for crime rates, and that the universalism culture of the Nordic countries provides less crime.
